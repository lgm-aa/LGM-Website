> This project is a modern overhaul of the Living Grace Ministry website, originally built over 10 years ago. The new site is built using React and Vite, with a focus on speed, responsiveness, and ease of maintenance. It integrates directly with external services like YouTube and Google Drive through client-side API calls to dynamically display sermon videos and weekly bulletins. The redesign simplifies content updates while providing a clean and accessible user experience across devices.
