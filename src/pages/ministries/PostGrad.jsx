              that sometimes we call “adulting”, we are faced with many
              challenges of how to stay connected to our faith, to ultimate
              purpose, and to each other. At LGM, it is our desire that you
              don’t go on this journey alone. Postgrad is primarily for
              after-college-aged folks, roughly early twenties to late-twenties
              but no one’s counting. We have grad students, working folks, and
              people still trying to figure out what’s next. We’d love to have
              you come check out Postgrad!"
