              together to explore their faith journey, build valuable
              friendships, and make positive impacts in the world. We’re a group
              of high school and middle school students (grades 6-12) who are
              passionate about having fun and learning about what it means to be
              a devoted follower of Christ who loves like Jesus, for life! “Let
              no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an
              example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.” (1
              Timothy 4:12)"
