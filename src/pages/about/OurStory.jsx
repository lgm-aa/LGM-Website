            We are a ministry that strives to live out grace practically in the
            Ann Arbor community. In the world today, grace is often in short
            supply. Even in churches, we do not always reflect the radical grace
            of Jesus Christ that would welcome ANYONE to come and that would
            call us to value even the least amongst us. Living Grace Ministry is
            a community where we want to see true transformation so that we can
            build Godâ€™s kingdom, and we encourage people to do so through love,
            forgiveness, and grace, not through judgment or guilt.

              Living Grace Ministry is a United Methodist Church. Formerly, the
              English ministry of Korean United Methodist Church of Ann Arbor,
              we are independent as of July 2023, but we still have a close
              partnership and relationship with the Korean Church. LGM is not
              all Korean, and we welcome anyone to join us for fellowship and
              worship!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are Christ-centered, outreach and mission-minded, and dedicated
              to training and equipping disciples and leaders. At LGM, all are
              welcome!
            </p>
